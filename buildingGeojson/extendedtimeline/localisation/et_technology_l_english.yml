 mil_tech_0_desc: "The most simple idea of warfare is to simply take a heavy object and start smashing the enemy."
 mil_tech_1_desc: "The spear has been used for hunting since the dawn of man, so it should be effective in hunting men as well."
 mil_tech_2_desc: "The bow allows to fight the enemy at a great distance, long before a melee opponent has a chance of fighting back."
 mil_tech_3_desc: "Centuries ago horses were too small to ride on, but now these animals have become capable of carrying humans into combat."
 mil_tech_4_desc: "In ancient times the chariot was the most fearsome unit on the battlefield. Now, however, they are becoming obsolete due to the incresed significance of cavalry."
 mil_tech_5_desc: "Through the course of human history, commonplace objects have been pressed into service as weapons. Axes are no exception. Besides axes designed for combat, there were many axes that doubled as tools and weapons."
 mil_tech_6_desc: "Early Iron Age swords were significantly different from later steel swords. They were work-hardened, rather than quench-hardened, which made them about the same or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to earlier bronze swords."
 mil_tech_7_desc: "The earliest cavalrymen were often unarmored and armed with low quality weapons. As the role of cavalry in the battlefield increased, they recieved better equipment and light armor."
 mil_tech_8_desc: "The Parthian shot was a military tactic made famous by the Parthians. The Parthian archers mounted on light horse, while retreating at a full gallop, would turn their bodies back to shoot at the pursuing enemy."
 mil_tech_9_desc: "A standing army is a permanent, often professional, army. It is composed of full-time soldiers and is not disbanded during times of peace."
 mil_tech_10_desc: "A war elephant was an elephant trained and guided by humans for combat. Their main use was to charge the enemy, trampling them and breaking their ranks and instilling terror."
 mil_tech_11_desc: "Without any armor, the large horses are easy targets for the ememy. By providing the horses with armor, the cavalry would survive better on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_12_desc: "Raiding is a military tactic that is not normally intended to capture and hold terrain, but instead to rob and pillage enemy holdings and then to quickly retreat."
 mil_tech_13_desc: "A composite bow is a bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together. When the bow is drawn, the sinew and horn store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made similar to that of all-wood bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow."
 mil_tech_14_desc: "Scale armour is an early form of armour consisting of many individual small armour scales of various shapes attached to each other and to a backing of cloth or leather in overlapping rows."
 mil_tech_15_desc: "A large group of horses charging full speed towards a defender is a scary sight and often even the most disciplined soldiers broke formation or fled."
 mil_tech_16_desc: "Covering both the rider and the horse in scale armor did slow the cavalry down a bit, but made it also very hard to kill."
 mil_tech_17_desc: "Constructing better fortifications is essential to slow down an advancing enemy or preventing our towns from being easily raided."
 mil_tech_18_desc: "Even the mightiest army doesn't do well without a capable commander. With the right tactics it is possible to beat back a far superior foe."
 mil_tech_19_desc: "A stirrup is a light frame or ring that holds the foot of a rider, attached to the saddle by a strap. Stirrups are used to aid in mounting and as a support while riding. They greatly increase the rider's ability to stay in the saddle and control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation and warfare."
 mil_tech_20_desc: "Providing all our troops with proper military training will increase their combat abilities as well as morale and discipline."
 mil_tech_21_desc: "Ring armour was believed to be a leather or textile item of clothing with a large number of metal rings sewn or tied directly into the foundation garment. Unlike mail armour, the rings are not physically interlocked with each other."
 mil_tech_22_desc: "Eventually smiths learned that by adding an amount of carbon to the iron, they could produce an improved alloy now known as steel. By quenching and tempering, swords could be made that would suffer much less damage, and would spring back into shape if bent."
 mil_tech_23_desc: "The natives of large grassland areas developed mounted archery for hunting, and for war. In battle, light horse archers were typically skirmishers; lightly armed missile troops capable of moving swiftly to avoid close combat or to deliver a rapid blow to the flanks or rear of the foe."
 mil_tech_24_desc: "Military organisation is the structuring of the armies of a state allowing better control, management and administration."
 mil_tech_25_desc: "The lance is a pole weapon or spear designed to be used by a mounted warrior. During the periods of Classical and Medieval warfare it evolved into being the leading weapon in cavalry charges."
 mil_tech_26_desc: "Camel cavalry were a common element in desert warfare throughout history due in part to the animal's high level of adaptability. They provided a mobile element better suited to work and survive in an arid and waterless environment than the horses of conventional cavalry."
 mil_tech_27_desc: "Although tempering swords was invented earlier, it took a long time before this was done consistently, and even until the end of the early medieval period, many swords were still unhardened iron."
 mil_tech_28_desc: "In ancient and medieval warfare, skirmishers typically carried bows, javelins, slings, and sometimes light shields. Acting as light infantry with their light arms and minimal armour, they could run ahead of the main battle line, release a volley of arrows, slingshots or javelins, and retreat behind their main battle line before the clash of the opposing main forces."
 mil_tech_29_desc: "Originally, knights or nobles were mounted warriors who swore allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him in exchange for an allocation of land."
 mil_tech_30_desc: "A bodkin point is a type of arrowhead. In its simplest form it is an uncomplicated squared metal spike, and was used extensively during the Middle Ages. Its main purpose was to penetrate heavy plate armor."
 mil_tech_31_desc: "Forming a royal guard would help in keeping the most important people alive and can also functions as an elite armed force during times of war."
 mil_tech_32_desc: "Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is the traditional code of conduct associated with the medieval institution of knighthood. Chivalry arose from an idealized German custom. It developed first in the north of France among horse soldiers who served in Charlemagne′s heavy cavalry."
 mil_tech_33_desc: "In hit-and-run tactics the purpose of the combat involved is not to seize control of territory, but to inflict damage on a target and immediately exit the area to avoid the enemy's retaliation. It is meant to have a psychological effect on the enemy's morale."
 mil_tech_34_desc: "The shield wall is a military tactic that was common in many cultures in the Pre-Early Modern warfare age. In general, a shield wall was formed by soldiers standing in formation shoulder to shoulder, holding their shields so that they abut or overlap."
 mil_tech_35_desc: "A crossbow is a type of bow consisting of a horizontal limb assembly mounted on a stock that shoots projectiles, called bolts or quarrels. The crossbow was the first projectile weapon to be simple and physically-undemanding enough to be operated by large numbers of conscript soldiers, in contrast to traditional bows which required considerable strength and skill to use effectively."
 mil_tech_36_desc: "On a sword, the crossguard is a bar of metal at right angles to the blade, placed between the blade and the hilt. Its purpose is to protect the swordsman's hands."
 mil_tech_37_desc: "Holy warriors were often devout or fanatic religious soldiers that would display great courage and valor when fighting infidels."
 mil_tech_38_desc: "A mace is a blunt weapon that uses a heavy head on the end of a handle to deliver powerful blows. During the Middle Ages metal armour and chain mail protected against the blows of edged weapons and blocked arrows and other projectiles. Solid metal maces proved able to inflict damage on well armoured knights, as the force of a blow from a mace can cause damage without penetrating the armour."
 mil_tech_39_desc: "Several inventions like the saddle, the stirrup and the spur allowed the rider to have better control of the mount. In western Europe there emerged what is considered the ultimate heavy cavalry, the knight. The knights and other similarly equipped mounted men-at-arms charged in close formation, exchanging flexibility for a massive, irresistible first charge."
 mil_tech_40_desc: "A longbow is a type of bow that is tall, roughly equal to the height of the person who uses it. In the Middle Ages the English and Welsh were famous for their very powerful Welsh longbows, used to great effect in the civil wars of the period and against the French in the Hundred Years' War."
 mil_tech_41_desc: "A longsword is a type of European sword characterized as having a cruciform hilt with a grip for two-handed use and a straight double-edged blade."
 mil_tech_42_desc: "A brigandine is a form of body armour from the Middle Ages. It is a cloth garment, generally canvas or leather, lined with small oblong steel plates riveted to the fabric."
 mil_tech_43_desc: "A pike is a pole weapon, a very long thrusting spear formerly used extensively by infantry. The pike, due to its unwieldy nature, was always intended to be used in a deliberate, defensive manner, often in conjunction with other missile and melee weapons."
 mil_tech_44_desc: "Plate armour is a historical type of personal armour made from iron or steel plates, culminating in the iconic suit of armour entirely encasing the wearer."
 mil_tech_45_desc: "The most heavily armoured troops of the Middle Ages were heavy cavalry such as the gendarmes and early cuirassiers."
 mil_tech_46_desc: "The creation of a professional military class is the first step to creation of a modern army."
 mil_tech_47_desc: "Charging blindly at the enemy is perhaps not the greatest tactic known to man, but it is one of the simplest to master. It is also the stepping stone to more advanced strategies."
 mil_tech_48_desc: "In 1500, during the siege of Pisa the walls started to crumble under the barrage of the French siege artillery. Local residents started to pile up the rumble outside, in form of a slopping rampart. This proved to be less vulnerable to artillery fire, while at the same time still able to resist an escalade."
 mil_tech_49_desc: "Throughout the middle ages cavalry's dominance was being challenged by disciplined pikemen. In battles such as Bannockburn or the Golden Spurs, cavalry was defeated by pikes. A combination of improved training and discipline, and the addition of swordsmen to provide close combat support has raised this formation to the peak of its efficiency."
 mil_tech_50_desc: "A pike is a remarkably simple weapon to make, but to get the full benefit from the use of pikes, it's required for the whole formation to be wielding weapons of similar length and blade."
 mil_tech_51_desc: "Although hand cannons had been developed in China in the 12th century and had spread to Europe by the 14th, the weakness of these weapons reduced their battlefield utility. Light and reliable Arquebus was able to displace bow due to three main factors. It had better armor penetration, it was easier to train men to use it, and it did not rely on the strength of the user."
 mil_tech_52_desc: "Artillery had been documented in Europe since the thirteenth century, but due to its lack of mobility, it had very limited battlefield use. The development of the Limber in the 1470s allowed guns to become more mobile and thus useful."
 mil_tech_53_desc: "The Arquebus was easy to use as a weapon, but was also inaccurate and slow to fire, leaving its user vulnerable to cavalry charges. Blending with Pikemen allowed Arquebusiers to fire and then fall back to be shielded by Pikemen when enemy cavalry or infantry appeared."
 mil_tech_54_desc: "In 1509 a monk and engineer tore down the medieval walls of Padua and replaced them with a rampart and a ditch which could be swept by flanking fire from the walls, adding an additional level of protection."
 mil_tech_55_desc: "Pike and shot formations proved a major threat to medieval knights. The initial response was heavier armor to counter the power of gunpowder weapons, but this slowed down cavalry, reducing their shock power. Reiters were usually armed with two pistols and a sword, allowing them to either shoot or charge depending on the opposition they faced."
 mil_tech_56_desc: "The Arquebus proved to be a very effective weapon for armor penetration, the result was that armor began to get heavier to resist its fire. A larger musket could deliver a heavier round offering better armor penetration "
 mil_tech_57_desc: "Spanish Square developed naturally from the Pike and shot formations. At its core was a traditional Pike Square. At each of the corners it had a group of Arquebusiers. It kept the staying power of the traditional pike square and enhanced it with the firepower of the Arquebus."
 mil_tech_58_desc: "The new and more mobile artillery had one problem - it could not be easily elevated up and down to adjust its firing range. Trunnions were cylindrical protrusions that acted as mounts for the gun on its carriage, which allowed it to be tilted and thus aimed better."
 mil_tech_59_desc: "It was difficult to fire around curved walls, thus once attackers got close enough to the fortification, the ability of other parts of the defenses to provide flanking fire was nullified. The development of star-shaped bastions allowed every part of the wall to be supported from other parts."
 mil_tech_60_desc: "The size and depth of the Spanish Square gave it staying power but made it slow and cumbersome to maneuver on the battlefield. It also led to a large percentage of troops being inactive during battles. Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, reduced the total number of men in the formation to make it more mobile and reduced its depth, so it maintained the same firepower and shock values."
 mil_tech_61_desc: "With artillery's growing importance in the battlefield, also the number of firearms kept increasing. But because each gun was made separately, it also required great effort to resupply. In 1544, Emperor Charles V declared that there would be only 5 calibres of gun, while King Henry II of France set 6 standard calibres."
 mil_tech_62_desc: "The matchlock firing mechanism's biggest weakness was the need to keep the match lit in order to fire the weapon. Although wheellock was developed, it was too expensive to produce to enter into mass use. The development of flintlock created a more reliable weapon."
 mil_tech_63_desc: "The carbine was a shorter form of the musket."
 mil_tech_64_desc: "Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, further developed infantry units to improve their firepower. His infantry formations were narrowed and made rectangular to increase the number of muskets that could fire in each volley. Attachment of small artillery pieces further increased the firepower of infantry."
 mil_tech_65_desc: "With development of new bastions engineers began to improve the art of positioning them to channel attacking armies into specially prepared killing grounds, where the defenders could inflict maximum amount of casualties on their enemy."
 mil_tech_66_desc: "Thanks to bayonets, each musketeer could function as a pikeman as well. This allowed pikes to be removed from infantry equipment and provided infantry formations with more firepower."
 mil_tech_67_desc: "In the 1620s the idea of combining the shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, allowed for faster reloading and thus firing. This in turn dramatically improved the firepower of guns."
 mil_tech_68_desc: "Heavily armored cavalrymen were by their nature cumbersome to form up and vulnerable on the battlefield. Lighter cavalry was added to armies to act as scouts for the army during marching and screen heavier cavalry before its charge on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_69_desc: "An outer ditch became a key area for the siege. If attacking troops gained control of the glacis, then the bastions would be lost. The ditch became the first line of defense for a fort. Access to this ditch, and ensuring it kept providing protection to defending troops became a key part of fortification design."
 mil_tech_70_desc: "Improvements in metallurgy allowed cannons to become lighter and more reliable. This allowed them to become more effective on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_71_desc: "First introduced to the Austrian army as irregular troops from the military frontier during the Seven Years war, Light Infantry Companies were deployed in loose order and proved to be very effective at harassing enemy and leading assaults on entrenchments."
 mil_tech_72_desc: "Although a musket could always be wielded as a club, it was not an effective hand-to-hand weapon. A bayonet was a blade that was fitted to the end of a musket, allowing the weapon to function as a spear. Initial bayonet designs plugged the barrel, making it an either or choice, but the development of the ring bayonet, which fitted around the barrel, turned a musket into a useful support weapon."
 mil_tech_73_desc: "Although a cuirass (or a breast plate) had existed for many years, only recently a new style of cavalryman gained popularity, with only a breast and back plate, which provided better balance between protection to the key parts of the body and mobility."
 mil_tech_74_desc: "Thanks to the building of several layers of fortification, overrunning of outer bastions simply moved the siege to the next layer, forcing attackers to prepare new locations to site guns and increasing the length of the siege."
 mil_tech_75_desc: "The introduction of light infantry troops led to a change in warfare. Skirmishers were deployed forward in loose order to distract and harass the enemy before the main infantry attack, which was typically delivered in either a line or a column."
 mil_tech_76_desc: "The musket's weakness was the fact that it was highly inaccurate beyond 50 yards. The rifle, although never a standard infantry weapon, added greater range to elite units, which gave the army a greater overall punch."
 mil_tech_77_desc: "Originally developed for siege purposes, the howitzer fired a high angled projectile over the fortifications and into the town inside. The field howitzer, a lighter more mobile variant, would fire an explosive shell above enemy troops. Mixed with other artillery types, it added to the effectiveness of artillery brigades."
 mil_tech_78_desc: "A needle gun is a firearm that has a needle-like firing pin, which can pass through the paper cartridge case to strike a percussion cap at the bullet base. A needle gun with a barrel that has a rifling cut into the barrel walls is also called needle rifle."
 mil_tech_79_desc: "Although breech-loading weapons were developed as far back as the late 14th century, breech-loading became more successful with improvements in precision engineering and machining in the 19th century. The main challenge for developers of breech-loading weapons was sealing the breech. This was eventually solved by the developments of the self-contained metallic cartridge and the interrupted screw."
 mil_tech_80_desc: "The Chassepot is a bolt action military breechloading rifle. A great improvement to existing military rifles in 1866, the Chassepot marked the commencement of the era of modern bolt action, breech-loading, military rifles."
 mil_tech_81_desc: "The first self-powered machine gun was invented in 1884 by Sir Hiram Maxim. The Maxim gun used the recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than being hand-powered, enabling a much higher rate of fire than was possible using earlier designs such as the Nordenfelt and Gatling weapons."
 mil_tech_82_desc: "Developing a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism for artillery, could keep the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since the gun would not need to be re-aimed after each shot, the crew could fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position significantly increasing the rate of fire."
 mil_tech_83_desc: "Some of our military engineers have come up with the idea of heavily armored tracked vehicles. These tanks could able to cross trenches, resist small-arms fire, travel over difficult terrain, carry supplies, and capture fortified enemy positions."
 mil_tech_84_desc: "The recent invention of airplanes could be useful for military purposes. They could be used for reconnaissance or to drop bombs on enemy territory."
 mil_tech_85_desc: "Although the tanks have proven to be useful in the battlefield, they are rather slow to turn and target the enemy. By installing a rotating turret on the tanks, they could fire at different directions without too much effort."
 mil_tech_86_desc: "Rocket artillery mounted on trucks is much more mobile compared to gun artillery. They can also fire several rockets at once achieving a much greater rate of fire."
 mil_tech_87_desc: "Extremely powerful nuclear bombs are capable of destroying entire cities in seconds. Even if not used, they have a demoralizing effect on the enemy as they know that their hometowns could be decimated by a press of a button."
 mil_tech_88_desc: "Combat experience during the World Wars had shown that most infantry combat was most likely won by the one with the highest rate of fire. From this experience was developed the assault rifle, which maximizes the rate of fire while having minimal recoil and reload time."
 mil_tech_89_desc: "The main battle tank is designed for filling the direct fire role in modern armies."
 mil_tech_90_desc: "With the help of a guidance system, our missiles will have a significantly increased chance of hitting their targets even across great distances."
 mil_tech_91_desc: "By developing robots for the riskiest and most physically demanding tasks, we could decrease the risks our soldiers have to face. Machines also never have to rest and they know no fear."
 mil_tech_92_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."
 mil_tech_93_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."
 mil_tech_94_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."
 mil_tech_95_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."
 mil_tech_96_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."
 mil_tech_97_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."
 mil_tech_98_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."
 mil_tech_99_desc: "In the future, the role of robots and indirect warfare seem to be increasing, and the wars will likely be fought over the increasingly limited recources of the earth."

 adm_tech_0_desc: "The most basic unit of governance is an extended family where all members of a community claim kinship with each other, a tribe in other words."
 adm_tech_1_desc: "In tribal despotism the tribe is controlled by an individual ruler with unlimited power and the ability to exercise any action without consequence or retribution, often ruling through fear."
 adm_tech_2_desc: "In tribal federation a confederation of tribes rule with a certain degree of internal autonomy but are nationally governed by a central authority."
 adm_tech_3_desc: "In tribal democracy all the members of the tribe are allowed to make their voice heard and influence how their tribe should be governed."
 adm_tech_4_desc: "In a barbarian tribe the strongest often gets to be the king. After the king's death, the title is passed on to his children, if can prove to be capable."
 adm_tech_5_desc: "Domestication is the process whereby living organisms are changed through generations of selective breeding to accentuate traits that ultimately benefit humans."
 adm_tech_6_desc: "Animal husbandry is the management and care of farm animals by humans for profit, in which genetic qualities and behaviour, considered to be advantageous to humans, are further developed."
 adm_tech_7_desc: "By building large monuments, we can please the gods and prove the glory of our people."
 adm_tech_8_desc: "A simple calendar would be useful for farmers as they could see the optimal times for planting and harvesting."
 adm_tech_9_desc: "Shines are small structures where people gather to worship the gods. Building more of them could strengthen our religion."
 adm_tech_10_desc: "A granary is a storehouse or room in a barn for threshed grain or animal feed. The stored supply of food will help us survive though bad harvests."
 adm_tech_11_desc: "Governing a country requires money and one of the most effective ways to get some, is to gather a regular tax from the people."
 adm_tech_12_desc: "Choosing the direction a country is going to take is perhaps the toughest choice a ruler will ever face. National ideas are the concepts that will shape our country for years to come."
 adm_tech_13_desc: "Rainfall is a critical factor to the success of our agriculture. Irrigation will help offset droughts and bring less fertile lands into cultivation."
 adm_tech_14_desc: "Building large forges will allow us to produce more weapons and other metal objects quickly."
 adm_tech_15_desc: "Different historical periods are reflected in literature. National and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras."
 adm_tech_16_desc: "The class system is a social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes."
 adm_tech_17_desc: "In a monarchy the country is ruled by the king who holds absolute power over his people. However, the nobles can hold significant amounts of power."
 adm_tech_18_desc: "Music was an important part of social and cultural life among ancient civilizations. Greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development."
 adm_tech_19_desc: "Laws are rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior. Laws were required to keep people from committing crimes or rebelling."
 adm_tech_20_desc: "A warehouse is a building designed for storage of goods. These warehouses will help us protect our valuables from threats like rain and thieves."
 adm_tech_21_desc: "Among the earliest government types known to man, the country is ruled by a single individual with undefined power."
 adm_tech_22_desc: "The introduction of wheels to replace the runner allowed the weight of the plough to increase, and in turn allowed the use of a much larger mouldboard faced in metal. These heavy ploughs led to greater food production and eventually a significant population increase."
 adm_tech_23_desc: "Constructing great temples will unite our people through religion and provide a great excuse to collect some extra money from them."
 adm_tech_24_desc: "Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language."
 adm_tech_25_desc: "Ancient horse harnesses pressed against the horse's muscles and trachea which restricted its breathing and reduced the pulling power. The collar allows a horse to use its full strength when pulling, essentially allowing the horse to push forward with its hindquarters into the collar."
 adm_tech_26_desc: "Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. Crop rotation gives various benefits to the soil like the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops."
 adm_tech_27_desc: "Constructing proper buildings requires proper tools. With more advanced tools we can produce products with greater presicion and efficiency."
 adm_tech_28_desc: "Since the early history of domestication of the horse, working animals were found to be exposed to many conditions that created breakage or excessive hoof wear. The invention of the horseshoe resolved these problems."
 adm_tech_29_desc: "A watermill is a structure that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process such as flour, lumber or textile production, or metal shaping."
 adm_tech_30_desc: "With the beginning of the Middle Ages, our wisest men have come up some new ideas we could adopt."
 adm_tech_31_desc: "Serfdom is the status of peasants under feudalism, specifically relating to manorialism. It is a condition of bondage or modified slavery."
 adm_tech_32_desc: "The empire is the highest ranked form of government. It is used for a large sprawling group of states that are united and ruled by a single individual."
 adm_tech_33_desc: "A workshop has the tools and facilities for producing various tools, instruments and other goods. Building these workshops will help increase our productivity."
 adm_tech_34_desc: "In a feudal system the power is shared between the monarch and the nobles, where labor or military services are offered in exchange for land."
 adm_tech_35_desc: "In a theocracy the nation is governed by the clergy in the name of God."
 adm_tech_36_desc: "Monastery is a building where monks or nuns live in seclusion and celibacy practicing various religious activities."
 adm_tech_37_desc: "A principality is very similar to feudal monarchy, but the monarch uses the title of prince or another title within the generic use of the term prince."
 adm_tech_38_desc: "A windmill is a machine that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades. Windmills were originally developed for milling grain for food production."
 adm_tech_39_desc: "In a merchant republic, the nation is governed by rich and powerful families with a heavy reliance on trade and commerce."
 adm_tech_40_desc: "The wheelbarrow appeared in Europe sometime between 1170 and 1250. The wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture."
 adm_tech_41_desc: "The oligarchic republic is a governmental form where a few patrician families hold the power and elect rulers amongst themselves."
 adm_tech_42_desc: "Improvements in the design of ploughs can reduce the workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_43_desc: "Theology is the systematic and rational study of concepts of God and of the nature of religious truths, or the learned profession acquired by completing specialized training in religious studies."
 adm_tech_44_desc: "Administrative institutions often grow out of the personal servants of high officials. This develops a complex administrative structure, where appointments to it were made entirely by inheritance or patronage and not on merit, and it was also possible for officers to employ other people to carry out their official tasks but continue to draw their salary themselves."
 adm_tech_45_desc: "The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle, wedge and inclined plane."
 adm_tech_46_desc: "A family structure with most senior members at the top can work for nonrelated groups. In its simplest form, the system is meritocratic, with leadership tasks assigned to the most capable."
 adm_tech_47_desc: "As social organization improves, so do things like food production. Increasing food production allows a society to upkeep people who aren't producers of food themselves. This leads to creation of a military elite, to defend against enemy's military elite. Supporting of the military elite is the basis of the feudal system."
 adm_tech_48_desc: "With a military elite to govern our society, the next stage of development is to have a literate class of administrators. Usually these will be drawn from the ranks of clergy."
 adm_tech_49_desc: "Choosing the direction a country is going to take is perhaps the toughest choice a ruler will ever face. As new thinkers and ideas are rising, there are more possibilities than ever before."
 adm_tech_50_desc: "Housing the machinery of government is as important as the machinery itself."
 adm_tech_51_desc: "Since the time of Charlemagne, people have been experimenting with switching from classic two field rotation systems to a three field system. It is time to promote this, as it will increase the amount of land devoted to growing food crops."
 adm_tech_52_desc: "The notion of a noble oligarchy ruling the society has existed, since well, at least the Roman times, and remained popular in some parts of the world. Now this idea is once more gaining popularity amongst those who matter."
 adm_tech_53_desc: "The problem with a hereditary local nobility is that they tend to value their local interests over those of the rest of the nation. We need to steadily expand the reach of the government, which begins with two of the most important areas of administration, justice and taxation."
 adm_tech_54_desc: "Although it has been in existence for a long time, the scythe somehow still isn't the most popular tool for harvesting crops. By encouraging peasants to use a scythe instead of a sickle we will improve the efficiency of our harvests."
 adm_tech_55_desc: "The development of the social structure is not exclusive to the aristocracy. The clergy too have to improve their internal governance. This will assist in the development of modern thought in our country."
 adm_tech_56_desc: "The expansion of government, particularly in the area of revenue collection is of vital importance. Gradual improvements in the administration have allowed us to take the next step in government expansion."
 adm_tech_57_desc: "As art patronage became more important for the prestige of the ruler, the need for a constant supply of talented artists has also grown. The first Fine Arts Academy was founded in Florence in 1563."
 adm_tech_58_desc: "The more land we can cultivate, the bigger the population we can feed in that area. Gradual improvements in drainage have led to wetlands being brought into use."
 adm_tech_59_desc: "Towns have always been centers of trade and, due to their concentration of population, theoretically also great places to levy taxes. The problem is that people, unlike land, have a tendency not to stay in the same place. Improving our ability to keep track of people will allow us to better our administration of cities."
 adm_tech_60_desc: "Textiles were manufactured since time immemorial. The invention of stocking frame in 1589 was the first step towards the industrial revolution and the beginning of mechanization. This invention would lead to increase in textile production."
 adm_tech_61_desc: "Money and people are what we need to govern effectively. We need to create a class of administrators who are skilled not only in scholastic philosophy but also have a solid grounding in mathematics, the classics and the Bible. Secondly we need to ensure the stability of coinage by making it uniform in quality."
 adm_tech_62_desc: "The great medieval universities were of course great but they were not able to produce enough graduates to staff our growing administration. We need to expand our universities or we will fall behind."
 adm_tech_63_desc: "Promotion of religion will be crucial for the stability of the realm. Creating a market for debt and equity will ensure the growth of revenue for the state."
 adm_tech_64_desc: "It is not enough to be great, people must be able to see our greatness. The ancients knew how to display their greatness and we will do the same by building monuments to withstand the test of time."
 adm_tech_65_desc: "There are many people who demand to be given a role in the government, but in reality mostly want rewards without effort. A new interesting idea of absolutism is spreading, which is a system where we dispose of those parasites and govern alone."
 adm_tech_66_desc: "Large-scale woodlands are of course useful as a source of firewood and a place for hunting, but if the trees were to go, those lands could be used for farming instead."
 adm_tech_67_desc: "A new philosophical concept called constitutionalism has been developed, where the government accepts legal limits to its power. This is an intriguing idea, but I can't see it catching on."
 adm_tech_68_desc: "Rainfall is a critical factor to the success of our agriculture. New improvements in irrigation will help offset poor rainfall and bring less fertile lands into cultivation."
 adm_tech_69_desc: "They say an army marches on its stomach, but when you think about it, not only is this physiologically impossible, but also very unsettling as an image. However, there is no denying the importance of being able to feed one's army on the march. A system of grain depots will help with that."
 adm_tech_70_desc: "Having the technical means to improve land and thus production is useless without incentives to do so. By reforming the laws of land tenure we can provide greater incentives to adopt improved methods of production."
 adm_tech_71_desc: "Our thinkers continue to develop the flawed notions of constitutional limitations on government power. Amusing as these ideas may seem, they also inspire progressive thought in other areas."
 adm_tech_72_desc: "The importance that money plays in government cannot be underestimated. The need to collect revenue is important and knowing how much revenue should be collected is even more so. We'll be setting up an office to estimate how much tax should be collected."
 adm_tech_73_desc: "The basic plow in use in Europe has been unchanged since the Roman times. Now, thanks to improvements in design, the same plough can be made much lighter, reducing workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_74_desc: "These so called enlightened philosophers are nothing more than madmen, with notions such as the separation of church and state and sexual or racial equality. Still, their thinking has led to the development of new ideas in the areas of state and government."
 adm_tech_75_desc: "Fortunately for us, the so called enlightened philosophers didn't restrict themselves to writing subversive political treaties, but they also have come up with ideas in the areas of science and engineering. These are a boon to our economy and have led to an increase in production."
 adm_tech_76_desc: "These foolish revolutionaries think they can simply consign hundreds of years of progress to the dustbin of history, all in the name of such outlandish concepts as liberty and equality. We will defeat them through the tried and tested plan of stealing the bits and pieces of their ideas that we like."
 adm_tech_77_desc: "The old hand production methods are becoming obsolete by the introduction of new machinery. We must begin industializing our country or we will fall behind our rivals in productivity."
 adm_tech_78_desc: "Our scientists have discovered electricity and already built the first electric motors. This new source of power has a chance of becoming an essential tool for modern life."
 adm_tech_79_desc: "In the modern world tolerance and equality are becoming increasingly important. Our advisors suggest that we look into the possibility of abolishing the idea of state religion in favor of secularism."
 adm_tech_80_desc: "Making machines from regulated replaceable parts will save a lot of resources as the whole machine won't have to be replaced if just one part of it breaks."
 adm_tech_81_desc: "As the ideas of equality and liberty are gaining ground, women along with many minorities that are not allowed to vote are demanding equality and a right to vote."
 adm_tech_82_desc: "Assembly lines, designed for the sequential organization of workers, machines and parts, would allow faster manufacturing of goods along with decreased workload for the workers."
 adm_tech_83_desc: "A sociologist named Karl Marx has come up with an idea to remove the inequality of society classes. In socialism the government would ensure that everyone has enough of everything and noone gets too rich or poor."
 adm_tech_84_desc: "A new national socialist movements have been formed in some countries. They claim that democracy is outdated and ineffective and want to replace it with a fascist government."
 adm_tech_85_desc: "With the increased supply of electricity we are now able to bring it to all major factories. That would allow them to produce greater amounts of products."
 adm_tech_86_desc: "Many of our politicians agree that it's not good one person to have too much power. They suggest that much of the power regarding internal matters is transferred from the head of state to the parliament."
 adm_tech_87_desc: "Nuclear power has proven to be capable of great destruction, but if we manage to turn this power into electricity, we could satisfy the ever growing demand."
 adm_tech_88_desc: "Our scientists are researching new substances called plastics. They are moldable and durable and could be useful for numerous different purposes."
 adm_tech_89_desc: "All computers have so far been rather cumbersome and slow, but with more powerful ones being constantly developed, it seems like they could revolutionize the modern world."
 adm_tech_90_desc: "Experts say that we may soon run out of fossile fuels and that using them pollutes the atmosphere. They suggest we look for alternative, renewable energy sources."
 adm_tech_91_desc: "Many scientists claim that fusion power is the solution to the world's energy problems. It doesn't produce pollution or nuclear waste and is more effective than any earlier form of energy."
 adm_tech_92_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_93_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_94_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_95_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_96_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_97_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_98_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."
 adm_tech_99_desc: "In the future of administration democracy is likely to prevail even in those parts of the world that are still ruled by despots, but one can't say for sure."

 dip_tech_0_desc: "If we want something we don't have, we could get it from someone, if we in return give them something they need."
 dip_tech_1_desc: "Ancient seafaring often consisted of siple rafts or small boats mainly designed for fishing."
 dip_tech_2_desc: "The transport is a larger galley with less crew inside leaving enough room to transport regiments across the seas."
 dip_tech_3_desc: "The trireme was an ancient vessel and a type of galley. It derives its name from its three rows of oars, manned with one man per oar."
 dip_tech_4_desc: "Merchant ships are small and fast galleys designed primarily for trading."
 dip_tech_5_desc: "An alphabet is a standard set of letters which is used to write one or more languages based on the general principle that the letters represent phonemes of the spoken language."
 dip_tech_6_desc: "Building roads would allow our armies and traders to move faster across our country."
 dip_tech_7_desc: "The classical navy consisted mainly of rowed galleys. The ships would often stand side to side and the troops inside would then engage on combat."
 dip_tech_8_desc: "A naval ram an underwater prolongation of the bow of the ship to form an armoured beak. This would be driven into the hull of an enemy ship in order to puncture the hull and sink or disable that ship."
 dip_tech_9_desc: "Galleys dominated the pre-medieval naval warfare, and only minor variations were noticeable between ships from different countries."
 dip_tech_10_desc: "Trading goods to other goods is often vague and sometimes difficult, if one has to give half a horse for some weapons. Currency could solve many of these problems."
 dip_tech_11_desc: "Basic mathematics is useful not only in construction, but also commerce."
 dip_tech_12_desc: "In early naval warfare, ships were hard to sink. Combat would often happen with the technique of grappling and boarding enemy ships with soldiers."
 dip_tech_13_desc: "Caravans are a group of people travelling together. They were often merchants carrying their goods over vast distances."
 dip_tech_14_desc: "By trading with distant countries, we could acquire exotic goods that are highly valued among our local merchants."
 dip_tech_15_desc: "Paved roads would allow our armies to move even faster across our country."
 dip_tech_16_desc: "Greek fire was an incendiary weapon used in naval battles to great effect as it could continue burning while floating on water."
 dip_tech_17_desc: "The dromon was a type of galley and an important warship of the Byzantine navy until they were succeeded by Italian-style galleys. It was developed from the ancient liburnian, which was the mainstay of the Roman navy during the Empire."
 dip_tech_18_desc: "In naval raiding a raiding party would land from a ship to loot and pillage and then return to their ships and sail away before the enemy can retaliate."
 dip_tech_19_desc: "Large rivers are difficult obstacles for armies and traders. By building bridges we could make moving across the country easier."
 dip_tech_20_desc: "We could try to increase our trade profits by looking for new more distant trading partners."
 dip_tech_21_desc: "Using professional well-trained merchants would increase our trade efficiency."
 dip_tech_22_desc: "Creatings Shipyards specifically designed for building ships could increase the quality and speed of our shipbuilding."
 dip_tech_23_desc: "Providing our sailors with proper naval training could make our navies more effective in battle."
 dip_tech_24_desc: "In order to improve our own trade, it's sometimes useful to harm that of our competitors. This could be done by hiring professional privateers to steal their trade vessels."
 dip_tech_25_desc: "Clinker built is a method of boat building where the edges of hull planks overlap. Later the technique was successfully used in the Viking longship and the Hanseatic cog."
 dip_tech_26_desc: "Celestial navigation means navigation with the help of the stars. Its principles were already known for millenia, but was significantly improved in the Islamic Caliphate through the inventions of the kamal and the quadrant."

 dip_tech_30_desc: "Established trade networks would make it easier for traders to move across the country."
 dip_tech_31_desc: "Paper money was gradually developed in China. It reduced the need for risky transporting of gold and silver, it facilitated loans, since the gold or silver never left the possession of the lender and it allowed a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms."
 dip_tech_32_desc: "In the late Middle Ages the galleys ruled the mediterranean and other inland seas. They were used for raiding along the coast."
 dip_tech_33_desc: "By the medieval times, the domination of galleys was broken in the open seas, where there was a greater focus on sailing ships that were used mostly for troop transport. Galleys were still the main warships in inlands seas."
 dip_tech_34_desc: "Building marketplaces in order to promote trade will not only encourage commerce but also allow us to better tax it."
 dip_tech_35_desc: "Making proper maps showing all major roads and ports, would make it easier for our merchants to reach foreign centers of trade."
 dip_tech_36_desc: "With good bartering skill our merhants could be able to trade less valuable items to more valuable ones, turning in extra profit."
 dip_tech_37_desc: "If we gather information about underwater rocks, treacherous shallows and other dangerous spots from different merchants and mark them on our maps, it would help our merchants avoid them."
 dip_tech_38_desc: "The cog is a one masted trading vessel originating from northern Europe."
 dip_tech_39_desc: "A compass that uses the magnetic field of earth can show the direction at open seas more accurately than the sun or the stars."
 dip_tech_40_desc: "Sometime around the 12th century, northern European ships began to be built with a straight sternpost, enabling the mounting of a rudder, which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side."
 dip_tech_41_desc: "A guild is an association of artisans or merchants who control the practice of their craft in a particular town. The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of workers."
 dip_tech_42_desc: "Establishing small trade posts along major trade routes would increase the amount and effect of our trade."
 dip_tech_43_desc: "Earlier liquid compasses were often large and cumbersome to use. The dry compass is more reliable and easier to use."
 dip_tech_44_desc: "One of the most significant inventions in medieval naval warfare was the torpedo. The torpedo ran on water with a rocket system filled with explosive gunpowder materials and had three firing points. It was a very effective weapon against ships."
 dip_tech_45_desc: "Shipbuilding can mean a lot of different things, it is amazing how far you can get on a raft for example. However, this is not the same as creating a fleet to enforce policies of a state. This requires a whole different approach to the building of ships, as well as developing ways to control the navy you've build."
 dip_tech_46_desc: "The patterns of trade had been seriously disrupted in the 14th century, possibly due to plagues and pandemics. Now trade is slowly beginning to recover."
 dip_tech_47_desc: "The barque has a long history, beginning as an Ancient Egyptian river boat. However, since then the term has gradually come to mean a light ship."
 dip_tech_48_desc: "The first true ocean-going ship. Unlike galleys and cogs, Carracks can serve the role of proper ocean-going warships."
 dip_tech_49_desc: "Creation of legal and regional infrastructure in order to promote trade will not only encourage commerce but also allow us to better tax it."
 dip_tech_50_desc: "Overseas trade is very risky but also highly profitable. The development of financial instruments like letters of credit will help reduce the risk, increasing our profits."
 dip_tech_51_desc: "We can develop better relations with neighboring countries by establishing embassies in their capitals, allowing our ambassadors to maintain permanent presence in their courts."
 dip_tech_52_desc: "With an extra boost to naval morale, our sailors will conquer the waves and rule the seas. While our colonists will be able to brave the dark corners of the world, founding new settlements farther from home than ever before."
 dip_tech_53_desc: "Trade depots will offer central locations for trade goods to be accumulated and distributed from for higher trade efficiency. Dry docks will allow us to maintain a fleet able to protect our trade."
 dip_tech_54_desc: "Development of the lateen sail allowed Carracks to sail much closer to the wind than earlier vessels. Enhanced maneuverability made them superior to other ships."
 dip_tech_55_desc: "A Flute is a specialised cargo vessel capable of carrying a large load with a very small crew. Flutes were designed to be built cheaply and in large numbers. A useful ship if you need to move things across the oceans."
 dip_tech_56_desc: "Land transportation of a lot of cargo is simply too expensive, moving it by ship is more efficient. Building canals will allow ships to assist with our inland trade, while shipyards will provide enough ships to do so."
 dip_tech_57_desc: "The great wharfs and jetties will act as entrepôts for the world's goods. Let us build them and prosperity will follow."
 dip_tech_58_desc: "Roads will allow products to better flow to coastal markets, where ships built in our grand shipyards will pick up these goods to deliver them to customers in other countries."
 dip_tech_59_desc: "Galleys were light and small, and it was very difficult to mount cannons on them. The Galleass was a larger vessel capable of carrying a broadside of cannons like a man-of-war. To compensate for this extra weight, Galleass would be equipped with an additional sail."
 dip_tech_60_desc: "Galleon was created by lowering the forecastle and elongating the hull. These changes in design improved the speed and stability of the ship. Which was of vital importance for Galleons to serve as better gun platforms."
 dip_tech_61_desc: "Knowledge is power, but how do you share it? A letter from far off lands is just the solution, and a post office is a perfect place to send one."
 dip_tech_62_desc: "Further development of transport ships led to construction of larger and faster vessels, which still tried to maintain the simplicity of construction of the Flute. These ships fell under the generic term Merchantman."
 dip_tech_63_desc: "A Customs House was a government building that handled the neccessary paperwork regarding the import and export of goods in to the country, as well as collecting customs duty."
 dip_tech_64_desc: "The War Galleon, also known as a race-built Galleon, was built by reducing the number of decks on a Galleon. This sacrificed cannons for maneuverability, which proved to be beneficial in combat."
 dip_tech_65_desc: "Sugar is one of the most valuable commodities in the world. Refineries are vital for generating the sweet stuff that people love."
 dip_tech_66_desc: "Originally developed by Barbary Corsairs, this galley didn't carry as many guns as a Galleas, but it was smaller and far more maneuverable. This improved maneuver allowed it to be far more effective in combat."
 dip_tech_67_desc: "In 1614 a rather mad physician wrote a treatise suggesting that scurvy was a result of a dietary problem and could be solved by consuming lemon or lime juice. As it turns out, there was method in his madness and we have started providing this new diet for our sailors. Other countries call us limey now."
 dip_tech_68_desc: "Original frigate design described any ship that was built for speed and maneuverability. As the concept developed though, it became its own unique class of a ship designed to support ships of the line."
 dip_tech_69_desc: "A special version of the Frigate originally developed for operation in the Baltic. It kept a broadside of a frigate, but had a shallow draft and oars giving greater maneuverability in shallow waters, while sacrificing seakeeping in open oceans."
 dip_tech_70_desc: "The addition of a third deck was a small sacrifice in maneuverability for a huge gain in close combat. The additional deck gave the ship an ability to fire onto the decks of smaller two-decker ships, while at the same time protecting its own deck."
 dip_tech_71_desc: "The East Indiaman was the largest merchant ship built, it typically could displace in excess of 1,000 tons and measure over 175 feet in length. Those queens of the oceans were the most efficient way of moving men and cargo around the globe."
 dip_tech_72_desc: "Life at sea is full of dangers and thus the punishments need to be harsh. If they do not have a sufficient deterrence effect, we will quickly run into trouble. Over time a system of highly public punishments has evolved, and now the time has come to formalize those. This will greatly enhance discipline at sea."
 dip_tech_73_desc: "As trade grew, so did the risk. New ways of accumulating capital and managing risk needed to be developed. In Joint Stock Companies the risk of enterprise was shared among their many shareholders."
 dip_tech_74_desc: "Originally the midshipman was a rank given to an experienced seaman who worked amidships. Men who aspired to become officers would often choose to serve in this role. If we formalize this, and make it a precondition for acquiring the rank of a commissioned officer, we will ensure our future leaders understand the ships they command."
 dip_tech_75_desc: "A further reduction of risk came with the development of insurance. The ability for people to offset risk through payment of a small fee to an insurance broker allowed for further growth of trade."
 dip_tech_76_desc: "Building ships that are slightly faster than those of our opponents, even if the amount of this extra speed is so negligible that it is of no military significance, can still fill our crews with confidence and make our enemy wary of taking us on in an even fight."
 dip_tech_77_desc: "The ongoing trade deficit between Europe and China has caused a shortage of silver bullion in Europe and all over the world. Switching from silver coinage to gold coinage will allow new coinage to enter circulation and get trade flowing in ever greater amounts."
 dip_tech_78_desc: "The invention of steam power has led to significantly better means of transportation. With railroads we can transport goods and people very quickly over vast distances."
 dip_tech_79_desc: "Wooden warships have become very vulnerable to explosive or incendiary shells. Protecting the ships by iron or steel armour plates would help them survive naval combat."
 dip_tech_80_desc: "It's often vital to know quickly if something significant happens. With the help of a telephone we could deliver messages across great distances almost instantly."
 dip_tech_81_desc: "Sailing ships are slow and rely on the winds. By powering the ships with steam power, they could keep moving with great speed even against the winds."
 dip_tech_82_desc: "The radio would not only allow us to quickly deliver messages to other countries and the army, but also provide the masses with information and propaganda."
 dip_tech_83_desc: "The dreadnought, larger, better armed and better armored than any ship before, would certainly become the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century."
 dip_tech_84_desc: "Already in the 19th century in was shown that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects. Starting from this idea our scientists are developing the radar that could provide information about enemy movements."
 dip_tech_85_desc: "In any modern society it's vital to keep the masses loyal to the government and hostile to the enemy. This could be achieved by providing them with information and propaganda through mass media."
 dip_tech_86_desc: "Developing large armored battleships with dozens of heavy caliber guns is vital for any nation which desires to maintain command of the sea."
 dip_tech_87_desc: "Developing an international standard unit system would make everyday commerce and science between different countries significantly easier."
 dip_tech_88_desc: "Adopting aviation for civil and commercial purposes would make moving people and goods around the world much faster."
 dip_tech_89_desc: "Modern heavily armored warships are not easily damaged with traditional guns. Developing more powerful missiles for our ships would increase their firepower as well as their range."
 dip_tech_90_desc: "In the modern world easy and quick access to information has become vital. Though internet much more information could reach even greater audiences even faster."
 dip_tech_91_desc: "Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on an atomic scale. It could provide us with superior materials and faster computers."
 dip_tech_92_desc: "In the future of diplomacy, diplomatic relations are good and peace well enforced. Large scale wars seem unlikely, but one can't be too certain about it."
